  <title>Sounds Like Fest</title>
  
  <p>In the summer of 2014, I presented my current music-generating algorithm at this cool sound-art festival in Saskatoon, SK.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    Ivan Reese (Calgary) performs "A Shrinking Feeling"<br>...an autonomous algorithmic composition of music written and performed by a computer in real time. Inspired by the Gamelan music of Indonesia, which features dramatic surges in tempo and beautifully intricate arrangements of bell-tones and beating frequencies, A Shrinking Feeling explores mathematical infinity, a concept often seen in image and read as text but scarcely heard. The algorithmic system uses the passing of time to gradually shift, cycle, and transform each of the principal elements of music: melody, rhythm, tone, and texture.

  <p>Above, you can listen to a recording of the music that the system performed at the festival. Unfortunately, I had some poorly-configured settings, so the result wasn't an ideal presentation of the work. For a full writeup about the system, and to hear how it really should have sounded, take a look at my project <a href="/project/are-we-small-yet">Are We Small Yet?</a></p>
  
  <p>I also gave a workshop:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <b>Ivan Reese 2-4pm at The Two Twenty (220 20th St W)</b><br>
    Ivan will be exploring the process and techniques he uses to translate ideas of music theory into a computer, as well as leading some interactive exercises that weâ€™ll perform as a group. Ivan has also offered to help anyone who brings their laptop get set up to experiment with music algorithms.
