Long drones for wandering through starfields and nebulae, lots of percussive action for combat.</p><p>This 1-track album was recorded as an example of what such a music engine might produce. So this isn't real "generated" music, but rather something I recorded pretending to be a music algorithm, generating a soundtrack to an imaginary space game.</p><p>The game never made it past the planning phase, unfortunately. There isn't even any art — the photo used above was taken around the same time, and I used it for the album cover as a joke (because it says XYZ). My game-making partners and I had a big falling out, and we all went our separate ways.</p></section><section><h2>Download</h2><p>At your leasure, you can download an <a href="https://ivanreese.s3.amazonaws.com/chord/chord.zip">AAC</a> version, or <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralganglion">shoot me a line</a> if you'd like a different format.</p></section><section class="related"><a href="/music">Album</a> from <a href="/year/2011">2011</a>.
