    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>The second album in the <a href="/project/ganglion8">Ganglion8</a> series. The "rap" album. Warning: this one is a bit of trainwreck. It's probably the "worst" of my albums.</p>
    <p>I spent the better part of 4 years working on it, off-and-on, and never got to a point where I was happy with it. It's "finished" in the sense that I gave up. That being said, it has a few moments that are personal favourites among my catalogue â€” in particular, the second half of the last track should be played at ear-shattering volume.</p>
    <p>The album originally had 10 songs, in accordance with the rules of the Ganglion8 project. But the final track was a trainwreck, so I cut it from the album, and the album is better for it.</p>

    <h2>Bonus</h2>
    <p>I mentioned above that the final track was cut. When I get back to Canada, I'll post it here as a standalone download.</p>
    <p>And because I enjoy it so much, I should post a standalone version of the 2nd half of the last track. I think I have one kicking around somewhere.</p>
