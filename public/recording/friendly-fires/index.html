Music had completely lost its appeal for me. I hated all my albums. I'd never been part of a "good" band. Playing an instrument was as joyless and mechanical an experience as washing laundry.</p><p>A room opened up in a house in Calgary. Among the roommates were beloved, dearly-missed friends. I left Edmonton, and video games. I return to Calgary, but not yet to music. It took a few months in this wonderful new environment, and then a weekend alone, for me to be ready to start playing again. I decided, on a lark, to record an album dedicated to my new roommates. I borrowed a crusty/dusty USB microphone from my work, and spent the weekend hastily banging together an album. It was the fastest I'd ever worked — previous albums typically took months, some individual songs had taken multiple years. This was 5 songs in 2 days. It was invigorating, and filled me with an eagerness for creation I hadn't felt since the mid '00s. No surprise, <a href="/year/2013">the following 6 months</a> was the most artistically productive phase of my entire life. Pent-up energy and curiosity were freed.</p></section><div class="hero"><h2>Cover</h2><img src="https://ivanreese.s3.amazonaws.com/friendly-fires/friendly-fires.jpg"><p>A photo of some lush pigment-looking things I found on the ground in Darjeeling, India</p></div><section class="related"><a href="/music">Album</a> from <a href="/year/2012">2012</a>.
