    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>
      I'd spent the past two years living in Edmonton, trying — unsuccessfully — to make <a href="/game/breakin">video games</a> for a living.
      Music had completely lost its appeal for me. I hated all my albums. I'd never been part of a "good" band.
      Playing an instrument was as joyless and mechanical an experience as washing laundry.
    </p>
    <p>
      A room opened up in a house in Calgary. Among the roommates were beloved, dearly-missed friends.
      I left Edmonton, and video games. I return to Calgary, but not yet to music.
      It took a few months, and weekend cat-sitting at my parent's house, for me to decide to start recording again.
      I decided, on a lark, to record an album dedicated to my new roommates.
      I borrowed a crusty/dusty USB microphone from my work, and spent the weekend hastily banging together an album.
      It was the fastest I'd ever worked — previous albums typically took months, some individual songs had taken multiple years.
      This was 5 songs in 2 days.
      It was invigorating, and filled me with an eagerness for creation I hadn't felt since the mid '00s.
      No surprise, <a href="/year/2013">the following 6 months</a> was the most artistically productive phase of my entire life.
      Pent-up energy and curiosity were unleashed.
