Like most of the previous entries in the series, this is a procedural music generation program intended for live exhibition. It's written in ClojureScript — badly — and runs in the browser using the Web Audio API. The code is up on <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/diminished-fifth">HitBug</a>.</p></section><div class="hero"><a href="https://ivanreese.s3.amazonaws.com/diminished-fifth/d5/index.html"><img src="https://ivanreese.s3.amazonaws.com/diminished-fifth/diminished-fifth.png"></a></div><p>Click the image to view the project. Currently does not work on phones/tablets (soon). It takes a minute to load (8MB-ish). You'll know it's ready when the background turns grey and you see the word "Orchestra" in the top left. Then click the <strong>Play</strong> button to begin. There's no interactivity — just enjoy the music. Hit <strong>Pause</strong> if you need to, and then hit <strong>Play</strong> again to resume. <strong>Tick Once</strong> is for debug and you can ignore it. <strong>Fullscreen</strong> does what you'd expect — hit <strong>esc</strong> on your keyboard to exit. Finally, <strong>Sound Check</strong> plays a random sample from the system, and is useful when I'm wiring this up for a live performance.</p><section class="related"><a href="/intermedia">Intermedia</a> from <a href="/year/2016">2016</a>.</section></main>
