The common thrust among them is a return to the simple origins web design: inline CSS, no JS, no images — in effect, 1 HTTP request per page. For my website, I challenged myself to see how close to that level of speed I could get, while still having an artful and lush design with a touch of playful interactivity. My site has custom fonts, a fair bit of CSS, the occasional image, but it should still load with a small handful of HTTP requests in a small handful of seconds anywhere in the world, even on a slow connection.</p><p>For the <a href="/">home page</a> of the site, I wanted a big splashy graphic. Of course, loading such a big graphic would miserably slow things down. It occurred to me that I could probably procedurally render something — the necessary JS would only be a few hundred bytes. The initial render could probably happen within a few milliseconds. But what could I render that would be visually captivating? The "star bar" at the top of <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> has always stuck out in my mind as a super-simple, super-cool bit of web design. Stars are pretty simple — a dark background, some points of light, maybe a few cloudy color regions for that <a href="http://www.homeworldremastered.com">Homeworld</a> feel. Should be easy.</p><p>After a bit of experimentation, I managed to create a screenfull of stars and nebula-esq clouds that looked <em>almost</em> photographic. It loaded instantly, and rendered in under 40ms (depending on screen size — the complexity of the graphic is dynamic, to support a diverse array of devices). Success!</p><p>Then came optimization. Can I get that 40ms down to 20ms? Can I make it look as good on a dim monitor in daylight as on a bright monitor in the dark? Tweak tweak tweak tweak twe... and then I hit a bug! While optimizing the initial setup, I changed some code that was inadvertently resizing the buffer on each redraw, clearing the buffer. At the time, I was playing with moving the stars a bit based on the scroll position, for a fancy parallax effect that'd be impossible to do with static images (even multiple layers of static images, a la <a href="http://firewatchgame.com">Firewatch</a>). Suddenly, I had stars and low-opacity nebula colors sliding around, drawing again and again on top of the same buffer. And that was it! There's the high-impact splashy graphic I wanted for my home page. It loads faster than any image, renders super quick (with room for further optimization, natch), and is more striking and visceral than any static image.</p></section><section class="related"><a href="/code">Toy</a> from <a href="/year/2016">2016</a>.</section></main>
