It started as the name of a video game I intended to make. While working on a prototype, I created a music-generating system to provide the soundtrack. The game didn't pan out, but I used the music system to make a pair of songs, and released them as a micro album with this name. That music system continued to grow and evolve, and I eventually used a variation of it for an installation piece, and a separate variation for a live performance.</p><section><h1>The Game</h1><p>I have a working prototype of the game, but it's practically unplayable, so I'll just post a screenshot and some artwork here.</p><div class="hero"><img src="https://ivanreese.s3.amazonaws.com/a-shrinking-feeling/a-shrinking-feeling.jpg"></div><p>(More when I get back to Canada in the fall)</p><p>See also <a href="/game/breakin">Breakin</a> and <a href="/recording/chord">Chord</a> for other games I worked on around the same time.</p></section><section><h1>The Album</h1><iframe style="width:100%;height:120px" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3854177444/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=de270f/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://spiralganglion.bandcamp.com/album/a-shrinking-feeling">A Shrinking Feeling by Ivan Reese</a></iframe></section><section><h1>The Installation</h1><p>Go to <a href="/performance/plus-15-installation">+15 Installation</a></p></section><section><h1>The First Performance</h1><p>Go to <a href="/intermedia/are-we-small-yet">Are We Small Yet?</a> for a recording, info about the performance, and screenshots.</p></section><section><h1>The Second Performance</h1><p>I took a second crack at the "Are We Small Yet" version of this project, porting in to ClojureScript and adding some visualization.
