  <title>A Shrinking Feeling</title>
  
  <p>
    I've used this name for quite a few projects over the years. It started as the name of a video game I intended to make. While working on a prototype, I created a music-generating system to provide the soundtrack. The game didn't pan out, but I used the music system to make a pair of songs, and released them as a micro album with this name. That music system continued to grow and evolve, and I eventually used a variation of it for an installation piece, and a separate variation for a live performance.

    <h1>The Game</h1>
    <p>I have a working prototype of the game, but it's practically unplayable, so I'll just post a screenshot and some artwork here.</p>
