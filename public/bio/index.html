      <span>Personal History</span>
      In my teens I self-taught 3d animation, expecting that I'd rather enjoy a career as a computer artist. Thankfully, just before art school destroyed my life for the wrong muse, I realized my passion was for the technology, not the artistry. So I ripped my career in half: computer programming for the fortune, and music/art for the fame. Thus, the works featured on this site sit in the space bounded by these interests — software, music, art, and their mutant offspring. Granted, I have neither fame nor fortune, but if you only aim for the moon, you'll never get to Mars.
