  <p><b>Colour Month</b> is a very special time for my circle of friends. Every day of the month has a colour(ish) theme â€” red, blue, plaid, space, geometric. Everyone posts a self-portrait based on the color, usually involving a mash of high/low fashion and trick photogrphy. For this portrait, which was on the "red" day, I wanted to do something a bit absurd. I was going through a cyberpunk glitch phase, and so wanted to make an image that felt like my fond memories of the SEGA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)">Shadowrun</a> game, and the surreal low-budget Canadian sci-fi/horror film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videodrome">Videodrome</a>. I am thrilled that the pizza, which was spray-painted red, looks a bit like low-budget horror film flesh.</p>
