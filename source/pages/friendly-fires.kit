    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>
      I spent two years living in Edmonton, feeling dulled by my failed stint as an <a href="/breakin">indie game dev</a>.
      Music-making had completely lost its appeal. All my albums sucked; I'd never been part of a "good" band;
      Playing an instrument was as gleeless and mechanical as folding laundry.
    </p>
    <p>
      A room opened up in a house in Calgary. Among the roommates were beloved, dearly-missed friends.
      I left Edmonton, and video games. I returned to Calgary, but not yet to music.
      It took a few months in this wonderful new environment, and then a weekend alone, for me to be ready to start playing again.
      I decided, on a lark, to record an album <a href="/dedication-albums">dedicated</a> to my new roommates.
      I borrowed a crusty/dusty USB microphone from my work, and spent the weekend hastily banging together an album.
      It was the fastest I'd ever worked â€” previous albums typically took months, some individual songs had taken multiple years.
      This was 5 songs in 2 days.
      It was invigorating, and filled me with an eagerness for creation I hadn't felt since the mid '00s.
      No surprise, <a href="/2013">the following 6 months</a> were the most artistically productive of my entire life.
      Pent-up energy and curiosity were freed.
