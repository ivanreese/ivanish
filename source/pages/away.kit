    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>The "rap" album. This one is an unmitigated disaster. It's probably the "worst" of my albums. The train(wreck) of thought that lead me to put <em>years</em> of work into this album is what has in some way undermined nearly every creative project of my life: the reluctance to give up on things that don't matter, and direct my attention to the things that do.</p>
    <p>I spent the better part of 4 years working on it, off-and-on, and never got to a point where I was happy with it. It's "finished" in the sense that I gave up. That being said, it has a few moments that are personal favourites among my catalogue â€” in particular, <a href="/cacodaemon">the second half of the last track</a> should be played at ear-shattering volume.</p>
    <p>The 10th track was so poisonously atrocious that I (uncharacteristically) cut it from the album, and the album is better for it. I should well have cut the other 8-ish disasters, and just released the two enjoyable songs, <a href="/cacodaemon">Cacodaemon</a> and Angst Takes....</p>

    <p>The fun thing about Angst Takes is the fun thing about many of my songs: it starts out like a heap of trash scattered across the floor, and gradually pulls together and melts into... something winsome.</a>
