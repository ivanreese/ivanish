*How do you keep track of all the stuff you should work on, issues to fix, articles to read, things to do?*

I have a personal philosophy that it's okay for me to forget stuff. If something is really important, I'll notice it again in the future, and that's okay.

I'll add things to a todo list when it's convenient, or when I want to take advantage of that set of feelings (the feeling of putting it on the list, the feeling of seeing it on the list, the feeling of checking it off, etc).

When I don't want those feelings, I don't write it down. I fall back on the freeing feeling of not worrying about it, and then the annoyance (in a good way) of it continuing to nag at me if it's a serious issue that I really ought to fix, or the sparkling "oh yeah! I've heard of it" when someone else mentions that same movie, or the blissful ignorance of completely forgetting about it if it wasn't so important after all.
