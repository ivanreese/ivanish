<title>Mexico 2008?</title>

<p>THIS PAGE IS A STUB</p>

<p>My father, head of the film program at Red Deer College, was invited to the opening of a new film school in Mexico. I went along with him. These were the days before I could afford a laptop, and years before the era of ubiquitous handheld computing. I took only a point-and-shoot digital camera, and a sketchbook. No clue what happened to the sketchbook, though.</p>
