      <h4>Album</h4>

  <h2>The First Half of 2005</h2>
  <p>Life as a college dropout, with at least the usual amount of illegal, amoral psychosexual and mind altering exploration as you'd expect. Maybe a touch more. I apply and am accepted into an accelerated, inquiry-based Computer Science program at the University of Calgary. I realize that I love programming, and love making music.</p>
