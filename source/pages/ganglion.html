    This one is big. Ganglion was my musical alias from 2005 through the end of the decade.
    It spanned across about a dozen albums and several live acts.
    Ultimately, I changed the name to Spiral Ganglion in the early 2010s,
    since there were more and more other projects using the name Ganglion.
    Now there's even a K-pop idol group!
