This is just the first half, which I think I've "finished", and it's somewhat self-contained… so this might be it.

Nerdy details:

I wrote the song partly using the experimental notebook that I (et al) have been building at work. Will share some screenshots eventually.

It started as a piano jam, and I found a little ostinato in 11/8 that I decided to build the rest of the song around. So I tracked the piano and drums first, and then just improvised everything else on top.

I've had a rented cello for the past month or so, and that features pretty heavily. I think cello pizz + BC + organ is how I'm gonna do basslines from now on.

I *also* have a rented flute, and while I recorded a bunch of it for this song, [none of it made the cut](/feeling-good-being-bad) (…yet, I guess).

Other instruments:

* the 100 year-old hand-me-down wind organ from a local church that now lives next to my piano
* lots of bass and soprano clarinet
* the french horn Schuyler just randomly gave me
* singing bowl
* one little tiny synth bit that you'll never in a million years hear and go "that's the synth"; the thing you _think_ is the synth is actually the cello with a really tight high-feedback delay.
* I've pared my drum kit down to just the stuff that I really love. Kick, snare, floor tom, hat, ride, broken cymbal that works as a china, two crashes… and a tight stack of broken splash cymbals that sounds just like the $600 Meinl smack stack. Love it.
* my 6 year old loves these two tiny cymbals that, I think, were the hi-hat from a children's drum set that I somehow wound up with? She put them on individual stands, one tight and one loose. Turns out, the tight one works as a triangle-esq "ting" sound.
