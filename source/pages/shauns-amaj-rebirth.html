<title>Shaun's Amaj Rebirth</title>

<blockquote>
  Hey, how ya been? I wanted to ask - I'm putting out a little collaborative EP. Songs roughly 1:11 in length, each in a specific key and on a specific theme. Contribution can be literally anything sound based, I will add to, mix or otherwise manipulate. Would you be interested in contributing something? There's one final track, key is Amaj, theme is "resurrection/rebirth." Due date for the wav file (s) would be December 1st. Let me know what you think!
  Shaun
