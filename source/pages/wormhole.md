! Wormhole

When Jimmy and I recorded [Future of Coding #59 • Worse Is Better](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/059), our discussion ended with a lengthy, rambling digression about my graphical programming project, [Hest](/hest-podcast). I felt it was a bit self-indulgent, so when editing I decided to cut the whole digression. But I didn't just *cut* it — I opened a wormhole to… somewhere else… and stuffed the damned audio through the hole.

Now, the physics of wormhole travel are thoroughly understood and have been rigorously tested by science. In short, if you open a wormhole *inside a podcast*, the result is that a corresponding wormhole opens up in *some other podcast* somewhere else in spacetime — and any audio coming through one way obducts and thus "swaps" with the audio on the other side. This is why Future of Coding #59 ends with some weirdly alternate-timeline Jimmy and Ivan talking about… throwing bags of their own blood?

But where did that [Hest](/hest-podcast) digression go? Where *should* it have gone? The only clues are the small link at the bottom of the [show notes](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/059#links) which leads to this very page, and then the audio that came back through the wormhole. Very strange.

To create a wormhole, one requires a tremendous amount of matter be packed into a very small space, such that it forms a singularity which pierces the veil of spacetime, connecting two remote points. But to create a *podcast wormhole*, you just need a cello and french horn and a few hours with the house to yourself.
