! Maya

<p><a href="/3d-studio-max">3D Studio Max</a> is resolvedly PC-only, so I never had the chance to use it at home (where I enforced an exclusively Power Macintosh computing environment). My girlfriend at the time snagged me a copy of Maya from Kazaa. It never worked completely, but I quickly found the safe path through the brokenness, and managed to create a few pieces of nonsense glitch art.</p>
