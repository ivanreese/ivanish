  <title>Bryce 3D</title>
  
  <section>
    <p>Bryce 3D was the first graphics program I learned in depth. My parents bought me a copy as a birthday present when I turned 12 years old, and I took to it with an obsessive passion.</p>
    <p>Below, you will see the very art made by 12-year-old Ivan. They all have watermarks, because I just stole these images from my first ever website (which is <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/ivanarts/">still online</a>). Take that, child me.</p>
