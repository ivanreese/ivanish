Going to start keeping a log.

Idea:

Hest unfolds as a rule-discovery puzzle game.

You start with a single tool, maybe the edge tool. There are some points, and you need to connect them to complete the level.

Maybe there's text or imagery explaining what you need to do, like showing that you have to click and drag one point to another.

Unlocking a new tool should have fanfare. Maybe the game starts with the fanfare for the edge tool, and the tool is explained briefly.

You don't start with the ability to create any points, or give them any function. So you have to unlock functions (add, split, join, multiply, etc etc) one by one.

If any tools do more than one (eg: select-and-move does both selection and moving), you start out with a simpler version and gradually unlock a new ability with that tool and then get a new series of puzzles with it.

You also don't get control over time at first.

So gradually, the game takes you through each of the:

- tools
- functions
- controls (ie: time slider, camera nav)

…and it also teaches you how to use the functions to build algorithms.

like, eventually, it becomes a bit like opus magnum, one of those games where you get a series of increasingly complex challenges for things you need to make.

these challenges could fork off in various directions, so that you build up components needed to make something big:

- build a little game by first building up a vector library from scratch, and input handling, etc
- build a little SSG by first building up file reading, string processing, file writing, etc
- a little drum machine
- etc

…and it also teaches you how to use the time travel for debugging and experimentation.

perhaps there are secret additional puzzles you unlock by creating paradoxes. Sort of like Black Box — you should be able to unlock new things / puzzles by merely doing something _weird_ with what you already have.

Need some way to allow for free exploration (with whatever you've unlocked) in between pushing onward through new puzzles.

If people want to skip all the puzzles and unlock the full feature set, maybe they pay for that? (And that's how it supports development)
