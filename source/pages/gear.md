Sometimes people ask me about the gear I use. I'll collect it here for easier reference.

# Audio

I record podcasts and music.

### Audio Interface

MOTU M6

I've owned a handful and have used a handful more, and have a very low opinion of this product category at the entry level. The only brand I have a favourable opinion of today is MOTU. Their interfaces are USB class complaint, which means they don't need a driver. This is *crucial* because my previous two interfaces both hit end-of-life when their companies decided to stop supporting the software — fantastic hardware that'd still be working perfectly today, crippled by software.

### Microphones

#### [Earthworks M30](https://earthworksaudio.com/measurement-microphones/m30/)
At the time I bought these (2009-ish), they were spec'd almost identically to the QTC30, but about half the cost. I think the cost difference was likely due to market segmentation more than a difference in component quality or design.

I cherish these microphones. They're truly incredible tools. I've used the living hell out of them, for everything from preciously recording the tiniest little sounds in the studio, to being plunged in boiling water on stage (accidentally…), and they've done it all quite well.

I've also broken 2 of them. (They don't like boiling water, even by accident.)
