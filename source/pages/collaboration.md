! Collaboration is a scary word

Why? Well, mostly because I have a lot of different skills, music and coding in particular but also a modicum of visual art and a good nose for creatively interesting questions, and I love to work on little side projects and [explorations with friends](https://vezwork.github.io/polylab/dist/demo/2025_2/residency/枯山水). But I always overcommit myself. Even the smallest thing is an overcommitment, I fear. I never have time to finish things, then the weeks roll by since I last *had the the time* and my guilt grows. Sometimes I pay it down with an evening or weekend squirrelled away from other guilts; usually I just go [rupt](https://ivanish.ca/its-ok-to-forget/).

The [Frustration of Collaboration](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes) is supposed to be monthly. We often record the next one right after releasing the last. Then the unedited audio files sit on my hard drive, the weeks tick by, I keep thinking "I should do that, but it'll take an entire goddamn day" and I don't have many days to give.

What I do have is dad shrapnel. A few dozen spans of 5-15 minutes. I haven't trained myself to context switch into something useful. My score in Threes is pretty good — I've almost made a 3,072.
