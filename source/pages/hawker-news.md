! Hawker News

One of our [podcast episodes](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/061) inspired someone to write [a blog post](https://johnwhiles.com/posts/programming-as-theory).

It did okay on Hacker News.

Which, of course, means a hoard of jackals, gremlins, and dipshits descended upon [the comment section](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38324486) spouting sewage like an incorrectly plumbed fountain.

So I made a song about them.

Here you can listen to two versions â€” an instrumental, and one with these fucking goobers included.
