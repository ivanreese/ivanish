! Hawker News

Here's a little tune from [Future of Coding episode 70](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/70).

One of our podcast episodes inspired someone to write a blog post.

It did okay on Hacker News.

Which, of course, means a hoard of jackals, gremlins, and dipshits descended upon [the comment section](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38324486) spouting sewage like a poorly plumbed fountain.

So I made a song about them.

Here you can listen to two versions â€” an instrumental, and one with these fucking goobers included.

Kudos to Lu for ["Oh, Berd"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMJ1H3Ai-qs)
