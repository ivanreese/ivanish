<p>From the summer of 2021 through March 2022, I worked with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://szymonkaliski.com/">Szymon Kaliski</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wolkenmachine.nl/">Marcel Goethals</a> at Ink & Switch on Crosscut — a drawing tool for modelling and manipulating your thoughts. We built a lovely iPad prototype, and then wrote an extensive essay.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/crosscut/">Read the essay.</a></p>
