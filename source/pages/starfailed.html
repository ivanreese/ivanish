    Some websites are just <i>unbelievably</i> quick — James Hague's wonderful <a rel="nofollow" href="http://prog21.dadgum.com">Programming In The 21st Century</a> is foremost in my mind, but there are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.deconstructconf.com">others</a>.
    The common thrust is a return to the simple origins web design: inline CSS, no JS, no images. In effect, 1 HTTP request per page.
    I challenged myself to see how close to that level of speed I could get, while still having a lush design with a touch of playfulness.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the <a href="/">home page</a>, I wanted a big splashy graphic (to keep up with current fashions, naturally).
    Of course, loading such a big graphic would miserably slow things down.
    It occurred to me that I could procedurally generate something. The necessary JS would only be a few thousand bytes. The initial render could probably happen within a few milliseconds.
    But what could I render that would be visually captivating?
    The "star bar" at the top of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> has always stuck out in my mind as a super-simple, super-cool bit of web design.
    Stars are pretty simple — a dark background, some points of light, maybe a few cloudy color regions for that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.homeworldremastered.com">Homeworld</a> feel.
    Should be easy.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a bit of experimentation, I managed to create a screenful of stars and nebula-esq clouds that looked almost photographic.
    It loaded instantly, and rendered in under 40ms.
    Success!
  </p>
  <p>
    Then came optimization: Can I get that 40ms down to 20ms? Can I make it look as good on a dim monitor in daylight as on a bright monitor in the dark? And interactivity: Can I make the stars slide around while scrolling, for a striking parallax effect (a la <a rel="nofollow" href="http://firewatchgame.com">Firewatch</a>)?
    Tweak tweak tweak tweak twe... and somewhere in the flurry, I caused a bug — or, rather, fixed a bug that had been present all along. While optimizing the initial setup, I corrected some code that was inadvertently reinitializing the buffer on each redraw.
    Suddenly, instead of a fresh image every frame, I had stars and nebulae drawing again and again on top of the same buffer. They streaked and puffed and flooded the canvas with color.
    And that was it, the high-impact splashy graphic I wanted for my home page.
    It loads faster than any image, renders in a flash, and is an immediate statement of identity.
