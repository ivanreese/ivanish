  <p>The last album I actually finished. The last dedication album. In my opinion, the best album I've yet made.</p>
  <p>I don't have a lot written here yet. Not that I don't have a lot to say about this album â€” rather, too much. It'll come.</p>
  <p>The photo is from my trip to Nepal, as my <a href="/nyc-london-a95">beloved A95</a> was just about to die. This is one of the last pictures it took. The purple banding was from the camera, not added in post.</p>
