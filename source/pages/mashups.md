! Mashups

I like to make the occasional mashup — video in particular. These silly little diversions are a lovely break from more serious work, and let me stretch some editing muscles that otherwise don't see much action.

I *came up* in the early web multimedia era of [Youtube poop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_poop) and [eBaum's World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBaum's_World). But I *grew up* in a culture of strict reverence for artistic integrity, a sort of high-brow *looking down one's nose* at anything "unoriginal". So it took me a good while (and a healthy dose of [Kirby Ferguson](https://www.everythingisaremix.info)) to feel okay sharing works of *culture* like these mashups.

So here you go!

Mariah Carey's **[All I Want For Christmas is You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQViqx6GMY)** and Battles' **[Atlas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpGp-22t0lU)** both share a particular triplet feel. I spent about a week with them rattling around together in my head before I finally sat down to bash out this edit. The video is meant to be hypnagogic, and the music is meant to be irresistibly danceable. Play it loud!

**[Erlang: The Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXmOlCy0oBM)** is miserably dry, despite the occasional dollop of retro charm. Joe Armstrong, the lovable creator of Erlang, comes across as a bit of a grump. There's much inadvertent humour in there, but it's buried — my "distractors cut" tries to pull that humour to the surface.

Finally, here's something lighter — a little joke about [Jimmy](/future-of-coding-podcast)'s choice of commit message.
