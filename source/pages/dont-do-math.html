  <p>As far as I'm concerned, this is the first <i>song</i> I've written and recorded in nine years. Sure,
  <a href="/never">there</a>
  are
  <a href="/shauns-amaj-rebirth">some</a>
  other
  <a href="/wormhole">tracks</a>
  that are, by some technical definition (say, the <a href="/music">ontology</a> of this very website), a "song".
  But those are short, simple, and insubstantial. This new song, however, is bigger. So, it counts. The others don't.</p>
  <p>You see, I had a 4-day weekend with the house to myself. So for the first time in nearly a decade, I set out to make another "album-in-a-weekend". And after arriving at this song, I decided to dispense with the goal of writing any more songs, and just make this one as good as I could.</p>
  <p>Usually I'm reluctant to discuss what any of my song lyrics mean. Not this time! This song is about the pressure I feel to come up with something <i>meaningful</i> when creative writing. I imagine people asking, "What does it mean?" Well, this time, it means: "Stop asking."</p>
