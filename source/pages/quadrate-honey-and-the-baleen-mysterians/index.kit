    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>QH&TBM started off with someone <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ganglion_(band)&oldid=300192211#Discography">editing the wikipedia page about my band</a>, adding a new album to our discography that didn't yet exist. I think it was Lucas, but.. yeah, who knows. I didn't-wasn't-couldn't create wiki-drama by reverting or flagging the edit â€” much easier to just make an album with that name.</p>
    <p>And so it was that I decided to use the name for the third <a href="/dedication-albums">Dedication Album</a>. This one goes out to Genre Slur, even though Kiri assured me that he <em>despises</em> this sort of music.</p>

    <h2>Bonus</h2>

    <p>Friend of the show <a href="https://trevorkjorlien.com">Trevor Kjorlien</a> used the first track as background radiation in his 2014 Halloween box-costume time-lapse video. Kaboom!

    <p>He did a write-up about it, which I will also <a href="http://ironjerkrevolt.com/01/23/15/making-halloween-costume-2014-video-and-why-i-need-one-project-year">direct your attention to</a>. He's a charming writer.</p>

      <p>The album was sold as a USB key, wrapped with antique photo, stuffed with a feather from my pillow.</p>
