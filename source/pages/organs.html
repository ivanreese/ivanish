  <h2>March 16th, 2013</h2>
  <p>I wrote 9 songs today, shamelessly journaling my progress <a href="https://d3um8l2sa8g9bu.cloudfront.net/organs/photos/recording.png">on fb</a>. The past six months have been the best in my life: surrounded by dear friends, <a href="err">falling</a> in love, music <a href="/2013">pouring out.</a></p>
  <p>I'm obsessed with <a href="http://www.jessicayh.com">Jessica</a>'s new series of paintings, and want to <a href="/dedication-albums">dedicate</a> an album to her / them.</p>
  <p>Kiri has basically stopped living at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Supermoon-Mansion/246862462108637">Supermoon</a>. I started these songs in her half-emptied bedroom as a quiet act of revolt.</p>

  <h2>March 17th, 2013</h2>
  <p>Making my way down the staircase in the morning, I was <em>hit in the stomach by a ghost.</em> Had to catch myself on the banister.</p>

  <p class="audio">
    <span>I felt horrible.</span>
    <audio src="https://d3um8l2sa8g9bu.cloudfront.net/organs/scraps/horrible.mp3" controls preload="metadata"></audio>
  </p>

  <p>Didn't eat all day, <a href="https://d3um8l2sa8g9bu.cloudfront.net/organs/photos/side-effects.png">dragged</a> myself down the hill to <a href="/roasterie">the Roast</a> for tea and fresh air. Freyja was there. I told her, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://youtu.be/11Ejzy8vCo8?t=21m47s">I feel like I'm being beaten up underwater.</a></p>

  <h2>May 17th, 2013</h2>
  <p>These recurring episodes of sudden, unexplainable, knock-you-over dizziness culminated at a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://thepsychicalliance.bandcamp.com">Psychic Alliance</a> show with Freyja. I sat in my car throbbing for an hour and a half, unable to see and constantly about to vomit, scared that if I tried to drive home I'd crash or hit someone.</p>

  <p>This time, it left me deaf in the left ear to all sounds above the middle register. The specialist later told me <a href="https://d3um8l2sa8g9bu.cloudfront.net/organs/photos/marie.png">nothing could be done to restore my natural hearing.</a> The episodes of vertigo gradually faded out, but the pain in my ear and the inability to hear clearly continue to this day.</p>
  <p>I then spent months trying to finish these songs, trying to make something I could feel confident in despite not being able to tell what they truly sounded like. For a few of them, I decided: better if they were intentionally painful to listen to, crackling and hissing and cranked up in the red. Others, I mixed so quietly that parts disappear into the fog. Some are emptied out, just the shell of a song, with no voice or no bass, just rhythm and hues.</p>

  <p>I'm releasing a handful of those 9 songs. I might as well accept that this album is never going to be finished.</p>
