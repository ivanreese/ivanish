! December Adventure

<section>

I'm currently doing my first [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure). Here's my daily log.

* **6th** — That's tomorrow. It's in the future. I haven't done it yet.
* **5th** — I'm taking a lil class called "Prototyping Programming Languages", and the assignment this week is to implement unification for a lil Prolog-like lang, so I did some of that.
* **4th** — No personal project today, just work programming: I made a camera out of a piece of paper.
* **3rd** — Worked on a website for a local group of basket weavers.
* **2nd** — **[BPS](/december-adventure/2024/2)** — Eli made a falling sand metronome. I made it [keep getting faster](/jerk).
* **1st** — **[CSS feed](/feeds)** — An RSS feed of my CSS rules.

Some ideas for things I might work on next:

* [Visual Programming Codex](/codex) needs an overhaul, probably using the same approach as the [Future of Coding wiki](https://wiki.futureofcoding.org).
* Speaking of: fix some bugs in the FoC Wiki
* Hest and/or Dust
* Get my [Blog](/blog) figured out
* Make some procedural creatures (I've got a particular tentacle monster from the Flash era that I'd love to revive, perhaps as an SVG)
* ZERO VOID page
* RakeBook (both the project and a webpage for it)
* general cleanup of this website — the various `<canvas>` JS files are a mess, and I could probably refactor them and make a shared std lib that they all build on.
* PPLs stuff! Oh no forgot about that.
* Did I ever make a page for Salamander?
* Knob
* Tone Dome and FOUR FOUR need writeups (hey… that's not coding!)
* Need to make music for Lu's TORN LEAF thing (what is happening to this list?)
* Edit the two FoC Episodes (get the fuck out of here, non-coding stuff)
* Really need to watch The Thing at som- (okay, I'm cutting you off)
