! December Adventure

I'm going to try doing a [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure). I've never done one before. I'll log my progress here each day as I go. [Wish me luck!](https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion)

Some ideas for things I might work on:

* [Visual Programming Codex](/codex) needs an overhaul, probably using the same approach as the [Future of Coding wiki](https://wiki.futureofcoding.org).
* Speaking of: fix some bugs in the FoC Wiki
* Hest and/or Dust
* Get my [Blog](/blog) figured out
* Make some procedural creatures (I've got a particular tentacle monster from the Flash era that I'd love to revive, perhaps as an SVG)
* Weaving Connections website (I guess)
* ZERO VOID page
* RakeBook (both the project and a webpage for it)
* general cleanup of this website — the various `<canvas>` JS files are a mess, and I could probably refactor them and make a shared std lib that they all build on.
* PPLs stuff! Oh no forgot about that.
* Did I ever make a page for Salamander?
* Tone Dome and FOUR FOUR need writeups (hey… that's not coding!)
* Need to make music for Lu's TORN LEAF thing (what is happening to this list?)
* Edit the two FoC Episodes (get the fuck out of here, non-coding stuff)
* Really need to watch The Thing at som- (okay, I'm cutting you off)
