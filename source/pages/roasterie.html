! The Roasterie

<div class="hero">
  <img
    alt="The words 'Time for another cup' are written with chaotic styling. Below, there's a photo of small dirty spoon on a saucer. It's all a bit gritty and gross."

<p>
  I didn't make this. It's just a beloved thing that I've rescued from the annals of history: a screenshot of the old Roasterie website. They have some <a href="https://roasterie.com" rel="nofollow">new website</a> now. It satisfices. But this one was the unvarnished truth.

<div class="hero outside">
  <img
    alt="A photo of the outside of the shop, a beautiful yellow awning with the words The Roasterie written in classy green lettering."
