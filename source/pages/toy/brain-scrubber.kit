    For Halloween '13, I made an interactive graphic where you can explore the inside of my head.

    After my <a href="/recording/organs">vertigo attack</a> and subsequent hearing loss, I was given an MRI.
    I asked the tech if I could have a copy of the data â€” and he said yes! I was not expecting to get so lucky,
    especially after having been so unlucky as to have lost my hearing in the first place, sigh.
    Nothing I can do, except make some art about it.
