  <title>Maya</title>
  
  <p>3D Studio Max has never been released for Mac, so I never had the chance to use it at home (where I enforced a staunch Mac-only computing environment). My girlfriend at the time snagged me a copy of Maya from Kazaa. It never worked completely, but I quickly found the safe path through the brokenness, and managed to create a few pieces of nonsense glitch art.</p>
