! Bryce 3D

<section>
  <p>Bryce 3D was the first graphics program I learned in depth. My parents bought me a copy as a birthday present when I turned 13 years old, and I took to it with an obsessive passion. Every day after school, I'd come home and spend <i>the entire rest of the evening</i> playing around, making silly space opera-themed renderings.</p>
  <p>Below, you will see the very art made by 13-year-old Ivan. They all have watermarks and compression artifacts, because I just stole these jpgs from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/ivanarts/index.html">my first website</a>. Take that, child me.</p>
