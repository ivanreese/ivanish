<p>Over the winter of 06/07, I was slowly coming to grips with recording. I bought an H4 portable recorder, and was struggling to find "my sound". I'd planned to make a double album named Point & Laugh. The album was soon to be torpedoed, the remnants dredged up and turned into <a href="/go">Go!</a> Even the names were eventually carved up and reused, for the albums <a href="/point">Point</a> and <a href="/laugh">Laugh</a>. Despite the roughness, there are some moments of Point & Laugh that were never rescued and reused, but dammit, maybe they should have been? Here's one.<p>
